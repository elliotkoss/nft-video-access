// Security Risks

--- Assuring access rights are transfered if one wallet address transfers a ticket to another.

--- User can create multiple wallets and obtain multiple tickets (keeping them for himself and selling them later on to make profit).

--- Ticket is still considered valid after the stream (should be an invalidator for the tickets).

--- Ticket should either be invalidated or burned after stream.

--- Once your in the event room, does sending the event room link provide non-ticket holders access?
